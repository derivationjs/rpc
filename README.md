# Derivation RPC

> This is a work in progress. Don't use this for anything you care about yet.

A TypeScript library for building **reactive, incremental, and type-safe data
streams** between a server and browser clients — powered by the
[`derivation`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/derivation) library.

This library provides a clean abstraction for synchronizing **reactive data
graphs** over WebSockets with automatically issued unsubscriptions when reactive
values are garbage-collected.

## 🚀 Installation

```
npm install @derivation/rpc
```
